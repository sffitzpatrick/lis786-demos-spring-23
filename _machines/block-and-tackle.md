A *block and tackle* or only tackle is a system of **two or more pulleys** with a rope or cable threaded between them, usually used to lift heavy loads.

The pulleys are assembled to form blocks and then blocks are paired so that one is fixed and one moves with the load. 
The rope is threaded through the pulleys to provide mechanical advantage that amplifies the force applied to the rope.

Hero of Alexandria described cranes formed from assemblies of pulleys in the first century. Illustrated versions of Hero's 
Mechan  ica (a book on raising heavy weights) show early block and tackle systems.
